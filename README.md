# Sinatra Birthday App

This is a basic web app using Ruby and Sinatra that tells the user how many days are left until their birthday, or wishes them a happy birthday on the big day itself.

This was the first web app I built from scratch as part of the Makers Academy course, and I followed the principles I've learned around TDD to ensure that all aspects of the simple app are covered by Rspec and Capybara for the interactive elements.

TODO: Make it look in any way reasonable.

## Usage

 - [ ] Clone the Github repository
 - [ ] Run 'bundle install' in the terminal in the parent directory
 - [ ] Run 'rackup' in the parent directory
 - [ ] Go to localhost:[the port in the rackup terminal output]

## Brief:
Your challenge is to build a web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:
- wish the user happy birthday
- tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

## Proposed screens:

Here are some suggested screens, but feel free to change the content, style and flow to make it your own.
